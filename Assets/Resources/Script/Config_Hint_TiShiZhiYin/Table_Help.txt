Victory Conditions\n* Both teams compete in resource collection within the dungeon. The first team to reach 4000 points wins immediately.\n* The dungeon lasts for 10 minutes.\n* If no team reaches 4000 points within 10 minutes, the team with the highest score wins.\n3. Elemental Orbs\n* Four elemental orbs (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind) will spawn in the four corners of the dungeon 1 minute after the start. Players holding an elemental orb gain victory points every 2 seconds.\n* Each player can hold only one elemental orb. When 1-4 members of the same team hold an orb, they gain 5, 10, 15, and 25 points respectively every 2 seconds.\n* Players holding an orb are affected by a vulnerability buff. For each stack, the damage received by the orb holder increases by 5%. The vulnerability buff stacks as the holding time increases.\n* Players holding an orb will become increasingly uncontrollable due to the orb’s power. While holding an orb, they cannot stealth, speed up, and some skills will have a cooldown.\n* Combining two orbs will summon a magical effect that weakens enemy team members. The specific combinations are:\nFire + Water: [Mana Burn] Increases enemy mana consumption to 200%\nFire + Earth: [Wither] Reduces the enemy’s physical defense by 70%\nFire + Wind: [Soul Shackles] Slows down enemies approaching the player\nWater + Earth: [Strong Freeze Barrier] Freezes the enemy if they deal a large amount of damage\nWater + Wind: [Static Field] Reduces the enemy’s magic defense by 70%\nWind + Earth: [Storm Barrier] Reduces the range of all enemy ranged attacks by 60%\n* Combined spells have a 15-second cooldown. During this period, switching orbs will not change the magical effect.\n* If Team A holds more than 2 orbs, the magical effect they summoned will be removed. At this point, Team B can summon the corresponding counter-magic through the [Dungeon Guardian] NPC, retaliating against Team A.\n* When a player holding an orb dies, the orb will drop, the combined spell effect will be removed, and the orb will return to its original altar position on the map.\n4. Buff Orbs\n* A buff orb will spawn in the center of the field 1 minute and 30 seconds after the start, and then every 30 seconds. Only players holding an elemental orb can compete for the buff orb, gaining 100 victory points and a random buff.\n* Buff types include:\n[Reveal] All allied team members can detect invisible units, lasting 10 seconds\n[Damage Increase] Increases damage dealt to the orb holder by 50%, lasting 10 seconds\n[Speed Boost] Increases the speed of the orb holder to 200% for a short period, lasting 10 seconds\n5. Kills\nEach time an enemy player is killed, the team gains 5 victory points.', Title = ''},
